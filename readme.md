=================

Starting project for the Game of Life coding kata using Groovy in conjunction with Gradle.

Getting Started
---------------

Have Gradle installed and configured to run from your command line.

Using Eclipse you can then generate the required project files using the `gradle eclipse` command. Or if your preferred development tool is IntelliJ IDEA the project files can be generated using the `gradle idea`command.

To run all tests inside the project just use `gradle test` and watch the output.

Have fun!
