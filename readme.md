# game-of-life-kata

Starting project for the [Game of Life][1] coding kata using [Clojure][0].

## Getting Started

This project includes a [Leiningen][2] project file with basic dependencies.
Make sure you have version 2+ installed.

Furthermore [clojure.test][3] and [Midje][4] testfiles are prepared so you can choose your
prefered testframework. Remove the other file or just leave the example test commented out.

The main source file can be found at `src/gol/core.clj`.

Have fun!
