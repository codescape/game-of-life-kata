=================

Starting project for the Game of Life coding kata using Groovy in conjunction with Gradle.

Getting Started
---------------

Have Gradle installed and configured to run from your command line. If you don't want to install Gradle on your system use the provided Gradle wrapper instead. To do so replace `gradle` by `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` (Windows) in every command.

Using Eclipse you can then generate the required project files using the `gradle eclipse` command. Or if your preferred development tool is IntelliJ IDEA the project files can be generated using the `gradle idea`command.

To run all tests inside the project just use `gradle test` and watch the output.

Have fun!
